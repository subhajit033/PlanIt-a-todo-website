# PlanIt-a-todo-website
This website is designed to help users manage their daily tasks and stay organized. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as set priorities and due dates. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making it a great tool for anyone looking to increase their productivity.

To build this website, I utilized my knowledge of HTML to structure the content of the pages, CSS to add visual styling and improve the website's user interface, and JavaScript to add interactivity and make the website fully functional.
